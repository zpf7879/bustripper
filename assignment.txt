As a new developer of Ruter's advanced client technologies team, you have been given responsibility of their
commandline bus trip client! It is used to query the first 10 upcoming transports from a searchable area in Oslo.
The previous developer on this team has unfortunately resigned, and you are to take over.
The last thing he did was to rewrite the code from a synchronous to a parallel architecture, as there was many
complaints that the client was slow in getting all the bus trips.

Your assignment for the first hour of the day is;

1. Bugs have been filed on the client not supporting input of place names with characters other than letters
   (examples are 'St. Hanshaugen' or 'Telenor Fornebu'). Can you fix this? Y, but not for St. Hanshaugen.

2. The previous developer had intended that pressing both "q" and just <enter> at the query prompt should stop the
   program. It turns out only one of them works. Can you fix the other? Y

3. On some searches ('Fornebu' or 'Oslo'), more than 10 results are printed and the cursor is not positioned correctly.
   Can you fix this? Y

4. Perform a code review of the current code. Make notes of What works, identify bugs and suggest improvements.
   Prepare a discussion around your findings. There is no need to code corrections here. OK

5. Still there are complaints, that in situations where network is slow, the output of the bus lines are messy.
   What can be the explanations of these? Plan (but don't code) what needs to be changed to be more robust against
   slow networks. OK
